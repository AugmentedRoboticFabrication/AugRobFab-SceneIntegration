# A Vision-based Sensing Framework for Augmented Robotic Fabrication

## Overview

This module is part of a vision-based sensing framework aimed at digitally reconstructing and registering the work environment. It enables robotic tooling on indefinite surfaces by providing accurate, reliable, and efficient digital reconstruction. The module leverages advanced computer vision techniques to process data from RGBD sensors, reconstructing the environment in 3D. For complete system functionality, refer to the [Hand-Eye Calibration Module](https://github.com/AugmentedRoboticFabrication/AugRobFab-HandEyeCalibration) and the [Jetson Board Azure Kinect Image Capture Module](https://github.com/AugmentedRoboticFabrication/AugRobFab-JetsonMKVRecorder).

## Installation

### Major Requirements

- **Visual Studio 2019 (v16.11)**: Install with the 'Desktop development with C++' option, including MSVC VS 2015 and MSVC VS 2017 components.
- **CMake (v3.28.0-rc5)**: Ensure it is added to the system PATH during installation for easier command line access.
- **NVIDIA Driver (v546.17)**: Required for GPU acceleration.
- **CUDA Toolkit (v11.8.0)**: Essential for leveraging NVIDIA GPU capabilities.
- **Anaconda (v2023.09)**: For managing Python environments and dependencies.
- **Microsoft Azure Kinect SDK (v1.4.1)**: For interfacing with the Azure Kinect sensor.

### Setting Up the Conda Environment

Create a dedicated conda environment using Python 3.9:
```
conda create --name augrobfab python=3.9
```

### Open3D Installation for Enhanced 3D Processing

1. Clone the Open3D repository (v0.17.0), a library essential for 3D data processing:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D.git -b v0.17.0
   cd <Path-To-Open3D-Directory>
   ```

2. Build Open3D from source, enabling CUDA support for high-performance computing and ensuring compatibility with the Azure Kinect sensor:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<Path-To-Open3D-Directory>" -DBUILD_CUDA_MODULE=OFF -DBUILD_AZURE_KINECT=ON ..
   cmake --build . --config Release --target ALL_BUILD
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<Path-To-Open3D-Directory>" -DBUILD_CUDA_MODULE=ON -DBUILD_AZURE_KINECT=ON ..
   cmake --build . --config Release --target ALL_BUILD
   cmake --build . --config Release --target pip-package
   ```

3. Install the compiled Open3D Python package within the conda environment to integrate it with your Python projects:
   ```
   conda activate augrobfab
   cd lib\python_package\pip_package
   pip install open3d*.whl
   python -c 'import open3d as o3d; print(o3d.core.cuda.is_available())'
   ```

### Installing Additional Python Dependencies

Navigate to the project repository and install necessary Python packages:
```
cd <Path-To-Scene-Integration-Repo>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
